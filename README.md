## Compilation:

```
$ make
```

## Execution:

```
$ ./quad
```

## Notes:

Computes the integral of a given function using the [Gauss-Legendre Quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature)
The order of quadrature can be specified in settings.conf
Accuracy is pretty good but not fully optimized.
